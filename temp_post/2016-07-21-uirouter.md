For routing, there are module named ngRoute released from official AngularJS project but most of projects are using ui-router(this is 3rd party module) instead of this because there are more benefits, such as supporting Nested-views / Nested-states.

This images is some simple example of web page structure. Component ui-view 1-1, 1-2 and 1-3 are inside of ui-view 1. Ui-view 1-3-1, 1-3-2 is being nested to ui-view 1-3. You can find similar form of web UIs with this easily, which are using tabs or slide bars to control main views. Most of the cases they are not using only one tab components in page. There can be tabs inside of tab, and they are being nested like parent-child-child-... structure.
