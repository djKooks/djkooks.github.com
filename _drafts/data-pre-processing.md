## What is pre-processing of data?
As I wrote in previous post, most dataset in real world are not clean. They are usually messed up, incompatible(ex:'-1' is included in data which defines people's age), and some of are missing. These kind of dataset will mostly cause error, or return wrong result when you just put on your elaborated logic. That's why you need to concern pre-process before researching it.

This is the survey from data scientists. You can find out this work will be unpleasure, takes lot of time, but also shows the importance of this work.

I'll add on some pre-processing logic in [previous post](http://djkooks.github.io/first-kaggle-research), to see how this process makes change.
