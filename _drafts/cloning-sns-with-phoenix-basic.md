While new year holiday, me and my wife(a Designer) was sharing idea of new side project and decided some basic concepts. Though it will be long-term project, and because it is side work anyway, so I wanted to challenge in new stuff to make this. 

Regardless of language or framework, making clone is a common way to be friendly with tech stacks. Therefore, I decided to follow-up some of cloning processes found in google.


## So, why Elixir and Phoenix?
bla bla bla


## Install and scaffold


## Modeling


## Make things work


## Show in UI


## Reference
