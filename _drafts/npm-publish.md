One way to show your output as a developer, is releasing a module which offers specific function to help development. Most of modern programming language has its own package manager(Python-pip, Rust-cargo, Java-mvn repo, ...), so it helps to release and introduce your stuff and make it simple to be used by engineers.
I once write a note about releasing project in [bower](https://bower.io/) package manager. But because of several problems, most of people suggest to go over to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and even bower project itself suggest to do as that way.
So in this section, I'm going t


## Why I did this
When I was developing front-end side(React + TypeScript), back-end side was developed in PHP and Python. Our team wanted to keep front-end side code to follow [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) rule, but parameters sent from back-end side was [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). It forced some of codes to follow snake case, so I thought of wrapping the response data, and convert parameter style directly.


## So, it is useful?
I really want to suggest this
It is important to think the usefulness, but actually, thinking too deeply will hesitate your work to create something, as I did. It does not need to be so great.
