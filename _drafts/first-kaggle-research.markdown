[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a platform for competiting data analytic and predictive modeling. Lots of companies post their raw data, and researchers compete to find best prediction from here. You can use `Python` or `R` for a research. 
Each researched records are called 'kernel', and you can make your own or look on other user's data. It is pretty similar with [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

It shows your your activiy during past 1 year, and can fork other people's kernel like Github. So if you are used to working these things, it will be more easy to start on.


### Titanic research

This is one of most famous topic in data research, and also `kaggle` suggest this as intro to the usage of `kaggle` platform. I'll not explain in detail about Titanic cause it is most infamous disasters and all of you will know about this very well.
In this research, given data is list of passengers and crew, and informations like age, embarked, sex, etc. are in here. Goal of this analysis is to find out what sort of people were likely to survive.

If you are first in data research so don't know how to start on, you can refer other people's kernel. Some of good kernels are commented very well to look and follow up how they work on. Or you can just look through blog posts in Google about 'Titanic data research' cause it is very popular tutorial. Also I'm a starter in this field, I followed research tutorial in `Datacamp` to start on.
